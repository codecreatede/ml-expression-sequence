# expression-sequence-ml

- a automated framework for the sequence to expression machine learning.
- it takes the fasta sequences, expression  file from the expression analysis and then writes the pickle file: a automated framework for the sequence to expression machine learning.
- it takes the fasta sequences, expression file from the expression analysis and then writes the pickle file for the automated machine learning.
- It goes through all the classifier and gives you all the classifier and you can select the one based on the precision and accuracy call.
- It writes pickle file with the highest protocol. since machine learning algorithms dont allow for the item assignment so i have put all the iterations as pickle file, you can remove the string variable and run them.
